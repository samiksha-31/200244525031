## Cloud Services:-
Cloud services are the services that are provided on lease with locking period on the cloud. The services can be applications, servers, virtual desktops or development platforms.
The AWS(Amazon Web Services) provides services like EC-2, RDS, S3.

**Levels of Abstraction:**
1. *Saas* - Software as a Service 
Example : Tableau, Splunk
2. *PaaS* - Platform as a Service
Example : Hosted database(RDS), Hadoop
3. *IaaS* - Infrastructure as a Service
Example : Virtual Machine(EC2), Disks(Volume)


## Security
* Cloud security consists of a set of policies, controls and procedures that work together to protect cloud-based systems. 
* A security group acts as a virtual firewall to an instance to control the inbound and outbound traffic.
* When multiple security groups are associated with an instance, the rules from each security group are effectively aggregated to create one set of rules.
* When a security group is specified as the source or destination for a rule, the rule affects all instances that are associated with the security group.

**Firewall:**
It monitors the network traffic of a system
*Inbound* - Controls the incoming traffic
*Outbound* - Controls the outgoing traffic

##S3
* S3(Simple Storage Service) is storage for the internet. 
* It is used to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time from anywhere on the web.
* S3 can be used to create buckets. Buckets are like containers for data storage.
* Infinite amount of data can be stored in a bucket. Each object is stored and retrieved using a unique developer-assigned key.
